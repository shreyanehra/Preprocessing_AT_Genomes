# Preprocessing_AT_Genomes
This program was designed to extract precursor nucleotides preceding the start codon "ATG" from the input FASTA file containing genomic sequences and produce an output FASTA file with the processed sequences.

## Installing dependencies 
   ```bash
   pip install biopython 
```
## Running the program
Replace "input.fasta" with the path to your actual input FASTA file containing sequences.
   ```bash
   python main.py
```
